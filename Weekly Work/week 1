Tips:
* Combines the two conceptually different methods of sparse regression and deep learning for Alzheimer s disease/mild cognitive 
impairment diagnosis and prognosis.
* Sparse regression + CNN ->DeepESRNet
* The sparse regression model plays the role of predicting target outputs, which we consider as abstract feature representation, 
along with informative features selection.

Thinking:
According to this literature, I am thinking about whether I can use simple sparse relevent model
