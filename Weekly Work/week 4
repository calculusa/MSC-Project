1. Learn about deep belief network.
2. According to the paper Mufidah2017, imitating the structure of deep belief network, and implement the network.
  1) pre-processing in this paper: voxel-based morphometric method
  2) feature that used in this paper: VOI, 3D mask, gray matters volume
  3) feature vector: MSD, VV
  4) the structure of DBN used in this paper: 3 hidden layer, fine-tuned 3 parameters (epoch, momentum, number of nodes in each layer ) 
  5) the aim for this paper is to classify the AD and the Health Contral
  6) Input of this network: feature vector
     Output of this network: AD or HC
